In a paper, describe the graphics pipeline, beginning with renderable geometry on the host
processor and ending with the display, to a non-technical person. In other words, if my nontechnical
mother were to ask you "What's the graphics pipeline?", this is the document that you
would write. While you must write in terms that a non-technical person can understand, you must
also be correctâ€”you cannot make statements that an expert in the field would recognize as untrue.
I expect in your paper you will discuss at least the following: objects are specified with triangles
and those triangles are in object coordinates; the geometry stage converts object-space geometry
to screen-space triangles; the rasterization stage converts screen-space triangles to
"fragments" (your decision if you can explain fragments correctly); what texture is and how it's
used; the process of composition to assemble an image from fragments; and the format and
mechanism by which a completed image is displayed. In addition, you must explain what is meant
by "programmable shading", again directed at a non-technical person. You are encouraged to have
a non-technical person review your document before you turn it in, because a non-technical person
will be grading it.
